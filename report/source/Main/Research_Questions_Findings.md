# Research Questions and Findings

In this section, we discuss our findings based on the pilot program research questions. 

## Time and Cost Implications

1. What are the review time implications of the RABET-V approach for:

      - The initial verification of a product from a new vendor?
    
      - The initial verification of a product from a vendor that have been through the RABET-V process?
    
      - The re-verification of a product?

1. What are the total cost implications of the RABET-V approach for:
    
      - The initial verification of a product from a new vendor?
    
      - The initial verification of a product from a vendor that have been through the RABET-V process?
    
      - The re-verification of a product?

1.  Is there a viable economic model for the RABET-V process? If so:
    
      - Does it require a government agency to drive the program, similar to voting system certification?
    
      - Is there a model that suppliers in the market can support?
    
      - Is there a model that states and localities can support?

1.  Will the process be efficient enough to keep costs low enough for vendors to make minor updates?

## Market Maturity Implications

1.  Is there evidence that products are architected in a manner that is mature enough for the RABET-V process to yield benefits by reducing the extent of re-verification reviews?
    
      - Will vendors be willing to submit small, frequent updates?

1.  Is there evidence that state and local adoption and acceptance processes can leverage the RABET-V process to yield benefits?

      - Can states and localities accept RABET-V verifications quickly enough to make the process worthwhile?
    
      - Will states and localities be willing to adopt new versions at a rate that maintains incentives to put small, more frequent updates through the process?

## Pre-Review Assessment Implications

1.  Is there a sufficient correlation between process assessment results and verification outcomes to use those assessments to expedite verification and re-verification under RABET-V?

1.  Should process assessments be renewed and, if so, how often or under what circumstances?

1.  What party is best equipped to conduct process assessments?

1.  Do architecture reviews provide a sufficient understanding of a given product to determine the impact of:
    
      - De minimus system changes?
    
      - Minor system changes?
    
      - Major system changes?

1.  Should architecture reviews be renewed and, if so, how often or under what circumstances?

1.  What party is best equipped to conduct architecture reviews?

### Technical Evaluation Implications

1.  For which types of non-voting election technology will the process work?
    
      - Is it better suited for some types of technology over others?
    
      - How, if at all, does the process have to be modified to make it more suitable?
    
      - Are vendors more likely to accept the RABET-V process for certain types of equipment?
    
      - Are states and localities more likely to accept the RABET-V process for certain types of equipment?
