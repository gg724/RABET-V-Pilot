# RABET-V Pilot Program Research Plan

The RABET-V Research Plan identifies how we will evaluate the RABET-V Process. We have identified the [research questions](Research_Questions.md) separately and outlined the process below.

## Working Model Input

The RABET-V Research Plan begins with a completed version of the RABET-V Working Model. All steps will be conducted according to the version of the Working Model which is current at that time. The version will be noted prior to each activity. Variations in the Working Model will come from lessons learned throughout the pilot. Comparing results from different versions of the Working Model will assist the team in developing findings and conclusions.

## Record Keeping

Many of the research questions are focused on the time and cost of activities. To answer these questions, we will ask all participants to track their time. We will convert time to cost using industry average rates, not rates from participants.

* CIS team members and contractors will record the number of hours per activity separated by pilot product
* Pilot participants will keep track of the number of hours spent per activity for each personnel role (i.e. 10 hours from software developer for architecture review)
* External parties will track the number of hours per activity separated by pilot product

In instances where hour tracking needs to be done on a more granular basis than activity, parties will be notified ahead of time. CIS will request each party's records on a monthly basis.

## Initial Interaction

### Activity 1. Submission

CIS will work with pilot participant to complete the required documents for the initial submission. See [initial submission](../../docs/source/Activities/Provider_Submission.md) for more details. Working sessions between CIS and the pilot participant will be done remotely. CIS will provide a way for the participant to send sensitive information securely.

### Activity 2. Submission Review Process

CIS will conduct the submission review process along with its Technical Advisory Committee.

### Activity 3. Process Assessment

The process assessment will be conducted jointly by a member of the CIS team and a 3rd party evaluator. The 3rd party evaluator will be experienced with conducting process assessments. The process assessments will be done remotely over 3-4 sessions with representatives from the pilot participant. There will be one process assessment per pilot participant.

### Activity 4. Architecture Review

There will be at least 2 architecture reviews conducted in isolation of each other for each pilot product. This approach will allow us to obtain independent results from different parties and different approaches. We will compare and merge the results. This activity will result in findings on which architecture review approaches or combination of approaches will work best.

To allow for iterative improvements to the Working Model, architecture reviews will be done in serial and the working model will be updated in between iterations.

### Activity 5. Security Claims Validation

### Activity 6. Testing Rules Determination

The CIS team will work with the non-vendor Steering Committee members and the Technical Advisory Committee to develop the testing rules for each product once Activities 2-4 are completed. This will be a transparent process for the pilot participant involved.

This is also this step where we will begin to understand the capabilities and limitations of the process assessment and architecure review to set meaningful rules.

### Activity 7. Product Verification

### Activity 8. Reporting

## Revisions

For the pilot, we assume the revisions will not require the process assessment, architecture review, or security claims validation activities to be performed again. We will conduct iterations of RABET which include only the Submission, Submission Review, Product Verification, and Reporting Activities.
