# Style Guide

This is a style guide for producing documents for *RABET-V* using *GitHub Flavored Markdown* (GFM).

## Formatting Conventions

| Convention | Explanation                                                                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Italics    | Introduces new terms and indicates emphasis.                                        |
| Bold       | Emphasizes a term or heade                                                          |
| `monospace`| Indicates identifiers used in source code.                                          |

## Abbreviations/Acronyms

- Acronyms should generally be spelled out the first time they appear in a section, as in: "Unified Modeling Language (UML)." After the acronym has been defined, you should generally use the acronym only (not the whole term, unless it makes more sense contextually to use the whole term). Spell out the acronym the first time it appears in a document (i.e. a Markdown file)
- Acronyms should be capitalized when expanded only if the term is a proper noun (and spelled that way by the company). For example, key performance indicator (KPI), but Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Headings
- All headings are initial-capped (or title case): cap the first letter of each word, with the exception of articles, conjunctions, and program names or technical words that are always lowercase.
- Prepositions of four letters or fewer are not initial-capped, unless they function as part of a verb (e.g., “Set Up Your Operating System”).
- Hyphenated words in subordinating conjunctions (e.g., as, if, that, because, etc.) are always initial-capped (even if they are four letters or less). Hyphenated words in titles or captions should both be capped if the second word is a main word, but only the first should be capped if the second word isn’t too important (it’s a bit of a judgment call). For example: Big-Endian, Built-in. See The Chicago Manual of Style.

## Lines/breaking

Do not use line breaks for formatting purposes.

## Lists

- Start with sentence case
- Do not add a period at the end of the line, even if it is a complete sentence
- List items should be treated as separate items and should not be strung together with punctuation or conjunctions

## Electronic Formats

Anchor URLs to text nodes whenever possible, like you would on a website.

## Dates/numbers
- Spell out numbers from zero to nine and certain round multiples of those numbers unless the same object appears in a sentence with an object 10 or over (five apples; five apples and one hundred oranges; 5 apples and 110 oranges).
- Whole numbers one through nine followed by hundred, thousand, million, billion, and so forth are usually spelled out (except with monetary amounts).
