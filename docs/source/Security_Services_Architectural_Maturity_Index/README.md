# Security Services Architectural Maturity Index

The SSAM index provides scores indicate how well the productâ€™s architecture is built to support each security service. This is a measure of the reliability of the security service and how isolated the security service is from other system changes. These maturity scores are measured during the RABET-V Architecture Review.

The SSAM Index provides a maturity score for each of ten security control families. The scores range from 0 to 3, where 3 is the best.

The SSAM Index provides maturity scores across a security service construction stream and a security service use stream. These streams measure maturity levels across different aspects of the system and combine to provide a more complete picture of the security of the product.
